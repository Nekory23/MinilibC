# MinilibC
{Epitech} | Second year | x86-64 Assembly

The objective of this project is to create a dynamic ELF library to replace (to a certain extent) the standard
C library you use every day on your system.

Thanks to the malloc project and the bootstrap, you are now able to replace some functions with your own
implementations through a dynamic library (which is called weak binding).

Here are the functions to be implemented in your MiniLibC:

- strlen
- strchr
- memset
- memcpy
- strcmp
- memmove
- strncmp
- strcasecmp
- rindex
- strstr
- strpbrk
- strcspn

Refer to the respective man pages of the aforementioned functions for behavior specifications.
You must stick to them.

See the subject for further details !
